Some Credits:

bounce 0-2 (.raw) from http://freesound.org/people/xDimebagx/sounds/331305/
bounce 3-6 (.raw) also from the above, but pitch changed in audacity (3 and 5 are from 1, and 4 and 6 are from 2)
bounce 7.raw ripped from the NES version of Arkanoid (I'm pretty sure Taito doesn't exist anymore, but if they do, and they still own the copyright on this thing tell me so I can remove it).
