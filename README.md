# Breakout
A simple Breakout clone for the 3DS [Uses sf2dlib, citro3d, and of course ctrulib.]
-Written by Magicrafter13 [Matthew Rease].

# Play
To play this, just download a precompiled binary (3dsx, cia, or elf) from the releases tab.
You can also use the 3dsx, cia, or elf file in the project folder itself, however this has no guarantee of stability,
since it's the equivelant of a 'nightly' build. [No longer available, but will be brought back when I introduce nightlies on my website.]

# Edit / self-compile
You will need the following libraries to compile this:
sf2dlib (and sfil, and sftd)
ctrulib (If you don't have this, you are either new to 3ds homebrew or you're just crazy.
    If you've set up homebrew environment, you have this.)
libpng (portlibs)
libjpeg (portlibs
