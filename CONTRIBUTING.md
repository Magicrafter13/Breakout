I am open to everyone contributing: Now I don't necessarily mean actually modifying the code, but rather suggesting code for me to implement. Since I'm new to coding in c and c++ I'll always try a suggestion.

Although before just suggesting random things, please check out the issue's page and see if there's anything you can help with. Then you can suggest things.

I don't have time for creating the wiki, but if anyone has suggestions for articles/pages to add, I'll review them and if I think they're good then I'll add them, and credit you.

[Oh yeah, and people with code suggestions and people who help with Issue's will be added in the credits page.]
