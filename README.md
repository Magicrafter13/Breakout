# Edit / self-compile
You will need the following libraries to compile this:
 [pp2d](https://github.com/BernardoGiordano/pp2d)
 [ctrulib](https://github.com/Smealum/ctrulib) (If you don't have this, you are either new to 3ds homebrew or you're just crazy.
    If you've set up homebrew environment, you have this.)
